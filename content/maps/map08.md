This is a georeferenced raster image of a historic printed paper map of the Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario region (Sheet No. 041K09), published in 1939. It is the first and only edition of this map, and is unusual in that the map was extended in order to include an area outside of the index grid, the Peninsula. A gridded version of this map (MB Grid System) was also published in the same year.

This survey was completed by the Geographical Section, General Staff, Department of National Defence.
