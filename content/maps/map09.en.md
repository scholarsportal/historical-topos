This is a georeferenced raster image of a printed paper map of the Niagara Falls, Ontario region (Sheet No. 030M03A), published in 1963. It is the second edition in a series of three maps, published between 1962 and 1973, and is unusual in that coverage extends into the United States of America. In many of these cases, information was obtained from the U.S. American Mapping series, before being scribed by the Canadian Design Service.

The survey for this map was conducted using aerial imagery, as part of a survey commissioned by the Canadian Army Survey Establishment (A.S.E.). These various surveys were under the Surveys and Mapping Branch of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, Government of Canada.
