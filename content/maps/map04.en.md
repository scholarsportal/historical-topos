This is a georeferenced raster image of a printed paper map of the Ottawa- Gatineau District, Ontario region (Sheet No. 031G05-G12), published in 1939. It is the second edition in a series of maps, published between 1931 and 1953. Unlike most other maps in the 1:63,360 series, this map does not cover a single index tile; rather, it sits in the middle of two separate tiles.
