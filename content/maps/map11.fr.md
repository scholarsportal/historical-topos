This is a georeferenced raster image of a printed paper map of the West Toronto, Ontario region (Sheet No. 030M11E), published in 1974. It is the third edition in a series of three maps, published between 1961 and 1974. It is unusual in that the map was extended in order to include an area outside of the index grid, the Toronto Islands.

The photograph used to create this map was originally taken in 1969, by the Lockwood Survey Corporation Limited, based out of Toronto, ON, Canada. These various surveys were under the Surveys and Mapping Branch of the Department of Energy, Mines and Resources, Government of Canada.
