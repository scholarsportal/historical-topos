This is a georeferenced raster image of a historic printed paper map of the Gananoque, Ontario region (Sheet No. 61), published in 1916. It is the first and only edition of this map, and is unusual in that coverage extends into the United States of America. In many of these cases, information was obtained from U.S. Mapping series, before being scribed by Canadian mapping agencies.
