  translation: '<p class="subtitle">Preserving Ontario’s Past</p><br>The Historical Topographic Map Digitization project was initiated by the Ontario Council of University Libraries (OCUL) Geo Community in 2014. It is a 2.5 year initiative to digitize and georeference early-to-mid 20th century historical topographic maps covering the province of Ontario at the scales of 1:25,000 and 1:63,360. The goal is to create and provide access to high-resolution map scans that preserve historical topographic information and meet the needs of current and future users.<br><br> The maps on the home page represent a sampling of the over 1000 maps in the historical topographic maps collection.
